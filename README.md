- Hi, I’m Jake Gallagher


- I’m interested in learning both front-end and back-end technologies but primarily focusing on front-end at the moment. 

- having completed most of the relevant courses on FreeCodeCamp and other tutorials I have now moved onto solidifying my learning by making my own projects which you can check out here on github.

- URLs for a few of the projects here:
    - https://jake-agallagher.github.io/React-Calculator/
    - https://jake-agallagher.github.io/Kanye-West-Quote-Machine/
    - https://jake-agallagher.github.io/React-Slot-Machine/


- the best way to reach me is through email at jake.a.gallagher98@gmail.com
