# Hi, I’m Jake Gallagher

#### I’m interested in both front-end and back-end technologies but I have spent most of the last year heavily focusing on front-end. I am currently looking for a Junior front-end web developer position. Once I secure a job I am then going to focus on becoming a full stack developer.
